> ### JavaScript was initially created to _make web pages alive_

- When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: _LiveScript_ (1995)
- by Netscape

---

> ### JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript
- it has no relation to Java at all (other that the decision to name it after Java in Dec 1995)

---

> ### JavaScript is what everyone calls the language

- but that name is trademarked (by Oracle, which inherited the trademark from Sun)

- Therefore, the official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript.

- ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Association

---

> ### JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a __JavaScript engine__
