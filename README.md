## Arrays are __Array objects__ with the following core characteristics:

#
- JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types

#
- JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, 
    - array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, 
    - but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.

#
- JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: 
    - the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on 
    - and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
#
- #### JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

## Loops

#
- ### __for__: loops through code a number of times

#
- ### __for/in__: loops through the properties of an object

#
- ### __while__: loops through a block of code while a condition is true

#
- ### __for/of__: loops through the values of an iterable object

#
- ### __do/while__: loops through code while a condition is true
